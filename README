Python script to calculate mismatches to reference genome where overlapping portions of paired-end data agree

Code to calculate mismatches to the reference genome in overlapping read-pairs. This Version differs from the
initial implementation that used random access to get the mate pair. I am now hashing the reads until its mate is
found.

Also need to write an implementation of Lawrence Etwillers DNA damage estimator. This basically just looks for
reverse complement agreement in the read2 read. # Need to think about this more i,e does the position of the
substitution matter in the read or is it just we see more G->T in r1 and less C-A in R2 irrespective if they occur
at the same loci. I'm not convinced DNA damage will be that critical we are requiring the pair to agree on the
exact location of the mismatch # Also is there Bias in this as there is strand specific (Transcribed) asymmetry in
Exome data. Will test with WGS if there is data available with enough sequencing depth . have downloaded the "high
coverage" HG0096 WGS and currently testing to see any pronounced differences
